<p> Advantage of Native development
<br>
- Developers have access to the full features and functionality of OS </p>
<p> Disadvantage of Native development
<br>
- Developers need to have separate versions for each OS (So if they want to have their apps on both IOS and Android, they will need to maintain two different sets of code, making development more expensive) 
<br> 
- Some users say Android studios load times are unbearable 
</p>
<p>(D) <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html"> Website/ Download page</a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/publishing/publishing-to-google-play/"> There </a> are some steps involved publishing an app to the Google Play app store.You must 
You first have to pay the $25 dollar regisration fee then you have to provide a picture icon and two screenshots of the application. There is no license fee outside the $25 dollar registration fee. There is a 15% transaction fee, so every dollar you make, Google takes 15 cents.</p>
<p>(T) Third -Party emulator which can be linked to the tool: You can install <a href="https://www.genymotion.com/"> Geny Motion </a> which allows the developer to set up multiple sensors for testing and run custom versions of Android.
In additon, the emulators run much smoother and faster than the default emulator that Android studio provides and allows simulation of input and outputs on the disk.
